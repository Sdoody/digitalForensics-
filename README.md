#SeanDoodyProjects 
This is a collection of projects I have done for school. Some of the work here I was required to use code from the book to
complete the projects. I have used alot of different languages throughout my years of coding. One of the my best languages is 
Python. That language is something that I have just grown to enjoy and learn really well how to use it. Some other languages that 
I have experence with are: C#, C++, C, PHP, and Java. I have a small amount of experence with Powershell and Bash as well.
